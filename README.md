### If you want to test it just

clone this branch

```bash
git clone -b deployed-on-pythonanywhere git@github.com:keinermendoza/blog.git
```

Create an activate your virtual enviorment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

```bash
python source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you have to provide an .env file in the root for the next valiables

```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com # if is gmal
EMAIL_HOST_USER=youremail@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=yourtokenpassword
EMAIL_PORT=587 # if is gmail
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True # if you want
SECRET_KEY=yourautogeneratedoryourrandompasswordfordajngo
```

Then you can migrate the database

```python
python manage.py migrate
```
finally don't forgget to
change my photo and name, and blog title. you will find them on:

```files
blog/posts/list.html
blog/base.html
```

Maybe you also want to change things as:
+ the **TIME_ZONE** variable in **settings.py** 
+ the lenguage page defined in the **base.html**
+ the error messages provided by the **forms.py**
+ the metadata provided in **base.html**
+ the email message in **views.post_share**

and thats all.

I'm learning with the book **Django by example 4**, this is my own version of the project 1.
You can consult the [code of the book](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-4-by-example) and see the differences.

If i make updates I will be uploading them to the main branch of this repository.
